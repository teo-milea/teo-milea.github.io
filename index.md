Hi! My name is Teo and I am an open-source engineer at OpenMined, working on the
future of privacy-enhancing technologies. 

While building tech could be a lot of
fun, quite often the impact on today's society could be if not negative, at least
questionable. This why I am looking to gain the knowledge to build tech 
that is not only cool, but meaningful to society. Also, I love teaching!

Education: I am the proud owner of a MSc in Cyber Security and a BSc in 
Electrical Engineer and Computer Science from Politehnica University of Bucharest.
