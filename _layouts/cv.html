            <b><a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PySyft</a></b> is 
            an open-source library for secure and private computation on remote
            servers. My responsabilities in the team are diverse and I have worked
            on multiples of its components over the years. Some notable projects
            to which I have contributed are: 
            <ul>
              <li>Scaling the <b>distributed architecture</b> for a production ready
                environment for <b>LLM auditing</b>.</li>
              <li>Implemented a <b>differentially private algorithm</b> using

          <p class="fw-bold" font-size=18px>Python Backend Engineer (March 2021 - July 2021)</p>
          <p>
            Designed and built a scalable <b>REST API</b> that managed access and operations for a
            cloud storage, task management, and email communication between 
            the customers and the company associates.
            Implemented scheduled tasks to help with the automation of 
            recurrent workflows, using third-party APIs and <b>HSM certificates</b>. 
            This project was done for a small IT company in Romania that worked
            for one of the largest management 
            <b><a href="https://mirus-group.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company</a></b> in the country.

          and self-exploration. We built
          it using a fusion of sensors that allowed a user to interact with a musical
          inteface run in Ableton using both learning and rule-based algorithms to
          detect static and dynamic gestures. We even got the chance to present it 
          during an exhibition where over <b>500</b> people have experienced it.

        <p>Since 2022, I have volunteered as a staff member in

          where we help research from multiple universities to collaborate on
          open-source research, usually around the topics of privacy, security,
          and robustness and fairness of Machine Learning models. 
          We provide monthly meetings, seminars and reading groups on these topics
          and managed to help dozens of internation collaborations.
