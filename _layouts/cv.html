            <a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft">PySyft</a> is 
            an open-source library for secure and private computation on remote
            servers. My responsabilities in the team are diverse and I have worked
            on multiples of its components over the years. Some notable projects
            to which I have contributed are: 
            <ul>
              <li>Scaling the distributed architecture for a production ready
                environment for LLM auditing.</li>
              <li>Implemented a differentially private algorithm using 
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11193">
                  individual privacy accounting using a Renyi Filter.</a>
              </li>
              <li>Lead the collaboration between OpenMined and 
                <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/federated">Tensorflow Federated </a> 
                which materialized in a 
                <a href="https://blog.openmined.org/announcing-proof-of-concept-support-for-tff-in-pysyft-0-7/">new way</a>
                to train neural networks within PySyft using Keras</li>
            </ul>

          <p class="fw-bold">Python Backend Engineer (March 2021 - July 2021)</p>
          <p>
            Designed and built a scalable REST API for an accounting company. 
            The API managed access and operations for a
            cloud storage, task management, and email communication between 
            the customers and the company associates.
            Implemented scheduled tasks to help with the automation of 
            recurrent workflows, using third-party APIs and HSM certificates. 
            This project was done for a small IT company in Romania that worked
            for one of the largest management 
            <a href="https://mirus-group.eu/">company</a> in the country.
